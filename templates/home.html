<h1>The Crossroads</h1>
<p>
  You wake up in a foggy clearing, an ache in your head. “How did I get here?” you ask out loud to no one in particular.
  As the sun begins to melt the fog, you see you’re standing at a well-worn crossroads. Along with the aching head you don’t remember where or really even who you are.
  There is a rustling in the trees and whatever it is sounds large! I have to get out of here! What way will you go?
