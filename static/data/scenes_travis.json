It's a small town, but its heart beats with the ambition of adventurersâ€”a haven for those seeking fame, fortune, or just a little excitement. The main street is a jumble of humble homes and shops, all leading toward the grand stone building that houses the Adventurer's Guild.\nAs you step inside, the low murmur of conversations and the clinking of tankards fill the air. A stocky, cheerful woman with a weathered face smiles from behind a large wooden counter. \"Here to see the quest board?\" she asks, her voice a warm rasp. Before you can answer, she calls out to a figure sitting in the corner. \"Hey, Olly! Got a new one for you!\"\nA young man with wide, bright eyes and a disarming smile stands up, adjusts the leather pack on his back, and ambles over to you. This is Olly, your newly assigned guide. He seems to know everyone and everything, a living encyclopedia of the surrounding lands.\n",
